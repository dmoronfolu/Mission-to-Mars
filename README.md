# Mission-to-Mars

Overview

In this module, we use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full resolution images of Marsâ€™ hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data and alter the design of the web application to accommodate these images. 

In the first deliverable, we scraped the full resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles. To accomplish this goal, we opened Jupyter Notebook, imported BeautifulSoup and Splinter and used these applications to scrape the full resolution images of the hemispheres and the titles of those images. 

In the second deliverable, we downloaded the code created in the first deliverable as a Python file, modified the index.html file we created in the module lesson to ensure the webpage contains all the information we gathered in this module as well as the full resolution images and titles for each hemisphere image. 

In the third deliverable, we are to ensure the webpage is mobile responsive and we to create Bootstrap 3 components

The final result is the html website we created for Mission to Mars which include the Latests Mars News, Featured Mars Images, Mars Facts and the four hemispheres and their titles. The titles on the hemispheres can be clicked on which directs us to the full resolution page for each image. The website can also be toggled to view in mobile mode.
